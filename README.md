PHP Forms library v1.1
=======================

##What
A PHP Form library that is mostly object oriented.  I was tired of looking at all the PHP Form libraries that were simply
arrays and this solves the problem mostly.  It's easier to work with in an IDE (class && function hints).  Fully documented
and has an example.

##How to use it
Check the example.  Pretty self explanatory

##Wishlist
* Fix all constructors to take label then validators
* Allow form to take multiple form items with the same label and add _(n) to the form id
* AJAX-y-ness
* Wizard capabilities
* Templating
